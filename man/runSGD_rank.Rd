\arguments{
\item{x}{For \code{calculateSGD}, a numeric matrix of expression counts or
mass spectrometry intensities where rows are features and columns are cells.
Alternatively, a \linkS4class{SummarizedExperiment} or
\linkS4class{SingleCellExperiment} containing such a matrix.

For \code{runSGD}, a \linkS4class{SummarizedExperiment},
\linkS4class{SingleCellExperiment} or \linkS4class{QFeatures} object
containing such a matrix.}

\item{...}{For the \code{calculateSGD} generic, additional arguments to
pass to specific methods such as \link{sgdgmf.rank}.
For the SummarizedExperiment and SingleCellExperiment methods, additional
arguments to pass to the ANY method.

For \code{runSGD}, additional arguments to pass to \code{calculateSGD}.}

\item{family}{The distribution family that is used for the estimation of
the parameters.}

\item{maxcomp}{Scalar indicating the maximal number of eigenvalues to
compute.}

\item{ntop}{Numeric scalar specifying the number of features with the
highest variances to use for dimensionality reduction.
Default uses all features.}

\item{X}{Sample-level covariate matrix. Defaults to column of ones.}

\item{Z}{Feature-level covariate matrix. Defaults to column of ones.}

\item{offset}{offset matrix with same dimensions as x that is added to the
linear predictor. Note that if family = poisson(),
this should therefore be on the log-scale}

\item{weights}{weight matrix with same dimensions as x that determines the
weight of each observation.}

\item{subset_row}{Vector specifying the subset of features to use for
dimensionality reduction.
This can be a character vector of row names, an integer vector of row
indices or a logical vector.}

\item{scale}{Logical scalar, should the expression values be standardized?
Not recommended for non-Gaussian data.}

\item{transposed}{Logical scalar, is \code{x} transposed with cells in rows?}

\item{BSPARAM}{A \linkS4class{BiocSingularParam} object specifying which
algorithm should be used to perform the PCA.
This is used in \code{runPCA} to put all information in the sample
latent factors.}

\item{BPPARAM}{A \linkS4class{BiocParallelParam} object specifying whether
the cross-validation
should be parallelized. If BPPARAM$workers > 1 and control.cv$parallel and
control.cv$nthreads are
not specified, parallelization is enabled with nthreads = BPPARAM$workers.}

\item{method}{rank selection method, see \link{sgdgmf.rank}.}

\item{normalize}{if TRUE, standardize the residual matrix for each feature.}

\item{exprs_values}{Alias to \code{assay.type}.}

\item{assay.type}{Integer scalar or string indicating which assay of
\code{x} contains the values of interest.}

\item{dimred}{String or integer scalar specifying the existing
dimensionality reduction results to use.}

\item{n_dimred}{Integer scalar or vector specifying the dimensions to use
if \code{dimred} is specified.}

\item{altexp}{String or integer scalar specifying an alternative experiment
containing the input data.}

\item{name}{String specifying the name to be used to store the result in
the \code{\link{metadata}} of the output.}
}
\value{
A list containing the eigenvalues. If a
\linkS4class{SummarizedExperiment} or \linkS4class{SingleCellExperiment} was
given as input, this is stored in the metadata of this object.

\description{
Perform an eigendecomposition for model selection based on a screeplot.
}
\details{
sgdGMF uses sampling of the data to estimate the parameters, which can
alter with different seeds. Also, cross-validation
puts a random selection of values to missing. This means that the result
will change slightly across different runs.
For full reproducibility, users should call \code{\link{set.seed}} prior to
running \code{runSGD} with such algorithms.
(Note that this includes \code{BSPARAM=\link{bsparam}()}, which uses
approximate algorithms by default.)

\section{Feature selection}{

This section is relevant if \code{x} is a numeric matrix with features in rows and cells in columns;
or if \code{x} is a \linkS4class{SingleCellExperiment} and \code{dimred=NULL}.
In the latter, the expression values are obtained from the assay specified by \code{assay.type}.

The \code{subset_row} argument specifies the features to use for dimensionality reduction.
The aim is to allow users to specify highly variable features to improve the signal/noise ratio,
or to specify genes in a pathway of interest to focus on particular aspects of heterogeneity.

If \code{subset_row=NULL}, the \code{ntop} features with the largest variances are used instead.
We literally compute the variances from the expression values without considering any mean-variance trend,
so often a more considered choice of genes is possible, e.g., with \pkg{scran} functions.
Note that the value of \code{ntop} is ignored if \code{subset_row} is specified.

If \code{scale=TRUE}, the expression values for each feature are standardized so that their variance is unity.
This will also remove features with standard deviations below 1e-8.
