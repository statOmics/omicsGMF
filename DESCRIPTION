Title: Dimensionality reduction of (single-cell) omics data in R using sgdGMF
Description: scSGDGMF is a Bioconductor wrapper for the sgdGMF \code{\link{sgdGMF}} package, which is a highly performant 
    and fast matrix factorization tool that can be used for dimensionality reduction, visualization and imputation of omics
    data. It considers data from the general exponential family as input, and therefore suits the use of both RNA-seq
    (Poisson or Negative Binomial data) and proteomics data (Gaussian data). It does not require prior transformation of
    counts to the log-scale, because it rather optimizes the deviances from the data family specified. Also, it allows to 
    correct for known sample-level and feature-level covariates, therefore enabling visualization and dimensionality reduction
    upon batch correction. Last but not least, it deals with missing values, and allows to impute these after matrix 
    factorization, useful for proteomics data. This Bioconductor wrapper allows input of SummarizedExperiment or 
    SingleCellExperiment classes.
